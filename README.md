This repository implements a pruning defense on a backdoored face recognition nueral network as described in this paper:

# Dependencies
## Libraries
* Python 3.6.9
* Keras 2.3.1
* Numpy 1.16.3
* Matplotlib 2.2.2
* H5py 2.9.0
* TensorFlow-gpu 1.15.2

## Dataset
Download the validation and test datasets from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jjcdL20CHWmAd9DsIdgP_B7IIEARKdSx) and store them under the [data/](data/) directory.

To run the program with your own data files instead, you can either provide the paths of the data files as arguments as explained in the [Usage](#Usage) section. 

Alternatively, you can run the program with default arguments by adding your files in the [data/](data/) directory with this naming scheme:
- "bd_test.h5" - poisoned test data
- "test.h5" - clean test data
- "valid.h5" - clean validation data

# Usage
The program can be run by [standard imports](#Running-the-program-from-aother-Python-file) or the [CLI](#Running-the-program-from-Command-Line-Interface). The default and custom arguments for the program are given in the [Arguments](#Arguments) section.

## Running the program from aother Python file
You can run the program with default arguments:
```python
from backdoor_detector import backdoor_detector

repaired_net = backdoor_detector()
```
You can also provide the program with custom arguments:
```python
from backdoor_detector import backdoor_detector

repaired_net = backdoor_detector(B_path="model/bd_net.h5", Dvalid="data/valid.h5", Dtest="data/test.h5", Btest="data/bd_test.h5", thresholds=[2, 4, 10])
```
This program will:
* save repaired models as '.h5' files in the same directory as the backdoored models at the specified thresholds
* save performance data as 'performance.csv'
* plot model accuracy and backdoor attack success rate against the fraction of neurons removed
* Return the repaired model as a goodnet object that is an ensemble of the original backdoored network and the repaired network

The saved model can then be used to make predictions on data:
```python
predictions = repaired_net(x_data)
y_pred = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)
```
## Running the program from Command Line Interface
You can run the program with the default arguments using this command:
```bash
$ python backdoor_detector.py
```
You can also provide the program custom arguments:
```bash
$ python backdoor_detector.py --model "model/bd_net.h5" --Dvalid "data/valid.h5" --Dtest "data/test.h5" --Btest "data/bd_test.h5" --thresholds 2 4 10
```

The program will:
* save repaired models as '.h5' files in the same directory as the backdoored models at the specified thresholds
* save performance data as 'performance.csv'
* plot model accuracy and backdoor attack success rate against the fraction of neurons removed

The saved model can be then loaded in a python file:
```python
from utils import *

B_path = "model/bd_net.h5" # path to backdoored model
B_prime = "bd_net_prime_20_percent_threshold" # path to pruned model
# load both models
B = keras.models.load_model(B_path)
B_p = keras.models.load_model(B_prime)
repaired_net = G(B, B_p)
predictions = repaired_net(x_data)
y_pred = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)
```

## Arguments
| CLI Argument | Short hand | Method Argument | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--model` | `-m` | `B_path` | path to backdoored model. Default: "model/bd_net.h5" |
| `--Dvalid` | `-v` | `Dvalid` | Path to the clean validation data. Default: "data/valid.h5" | 
| `--Dtest` | `-t` | `Dtest` | Path to the clean test data. Default: "data/test.h5" | 
| `--Btest` | `-b` | `Btest` | Path to the poisoned test data.. Default: "data/bd_test.h5" | 
| `--thresholds` | `-th` | `thresholds` | List of accuracy thresholds in percent. Default: `[2, 4, 10]`|

## Architecture
The baseline DNN used for face recognition is the state-ofthe-art DeepID network that contains three shared convolutional layers followed by two parallel sub-networks that feed into the last two fully connected layers.

The architecture of the model can is in the [architecture.py](architecture.py) file. A model summary and a flow diagram of the model is shown below.
